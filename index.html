    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m Nora Moser, a front-end software developer based in Washington (near Seattle). I have experience in both the finance and healthcare industries, and I specialize in building dynamic, user-friendly applications. My favorite tech stack includes JavaScript (React), though I also have experience with Node.js, PHP, and Laravel.</p>

        <li>Databases & Tools: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Azure, Apache, Git, Jenkins, Postman</li>
        <li>Development Practices: Agile, Test-Driven Development (TDD), MVC4</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Projects and Experience</h3>
    <p>I’m currently working on a personal website using React (frontend), Node.js (backend), and MongoDB. While many of my complex challenges have been at work, I’m always looking for new projects to push my skills further.</p>
